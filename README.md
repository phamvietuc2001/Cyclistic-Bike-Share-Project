# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Project

Here is another Business Intelligence project I did after taking the BI professional certificate. Specifically, it broke down into three phases corresponding with 3 courses to complete this project:
* The 1st phase (1st course) is to complete the BI documents, which include **stakeholders' requirements, project requirements, and strategy requirements**
    * **Stakeholders document** enables capturing stakeholder requests and requirements to understand their needs before planning the rest of the project details or strategy 
    * **Project document** contains the following: project's purpose, stakeholder requirements, success criteria, etc.
    * **Strategy document** deals with approaching the data and getting feedback from the stakeholders by creating data visualizations and dashboard mockups.
* The 2nd phase (2nd course) is to **consolidate** the data from **multiple sources into a target table** by using SQL and **load** it into the unified destination (Tableau in this project)
* The final phase (3rd course) is to create the **dashboard**, and the **slide-deck presentation** to present the insights to the stakeholders (here is the Tableau workbook: [Cyclistic Bike Share Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viet.pham4981/viz/Bike_17106188243660/NYCBikeTrip?publish=yes))

### Here is the scenario:
